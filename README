Features:

- The normals are calculated using three vectors tangent, normal and binormal. I initialized an arbitrary vector for N0. 
- The camera is pointing to the tangent of the track from a point on the track, the up vector is determined by the normal vector at that point.


Extra credit:
- Render double rail
- Render a T-shaped rail cross-section
- I added a support structure but it only works with the rollerCoaster spline file.
